Trumpet comes out as a new building block in the Hadoop ecosystem 
and unleashes brand new capabilities to HDFS. As it relies mostly on Kafka 
for the distribution of the events to the clients, it scales pretty well.

Here are the steps to let you write your own client applications:

## Dependency

Add the dependency to the Trumpet client in your project

```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.verisign.vscc.trumpet</groupId>
            <artifactId>client</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
```

## Use it

Now it's as easy as using an [Iterable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html).

```java
String kafkaTopic = ...
String zkConnect = ...
for (Map<String, Object> event : new TrumpetEventStreamer(zkConnect, kafkaTopic)) {
    ... do something with your event!
}
```

## Events Format

TODO!


## Example Application

`com.verisign.vscc.hdfs.trumpet.client.example.TestApp` is a sample application, listening to Trumpet and finding `_SUCCESS` files, 
indicating the success of a MapReduce application. 

It would be really easy to start a distcp job from here to, for instance, replicate the resulting data into a different cluster.
