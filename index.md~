Trumpet is an highly-available, distributed and scalable [HDFS](http://hadoop.apache.org/) 
[INotify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify)-like building block for Hadoop.

# Context

In real world Hadoop deployments it's common to run several HDFS clusters. 
When doing so, one of the challenge is to replicate the data from one side to another while finding 
the right trade-offs between the time before the data is replicated 
and impact on the existing infrastructure.

This project originated from our work at [Verisign](https://www.verisigninc.com), presented at [Hadoop Summit Amsterdam in 2014](http://2014.hadoopsummit.org/) 
(Hadoop Event Notification System, see [http://hortonworks.com/blog/congrats-hadoop-summit-community-choice-winners/](http://hortonworks.com/blog/congrats-hadoop-summit-community-choice-winners/)) 
which in turn brought inspiration to the community to build the HDFS-INotify building block, 
known as [HDFS-6634](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6634) and [HDFS-7446](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7446).

But HDFS-INotify is intrusive to the NameNode by design, i.e. it's built as an RPC command hitting directly the NameNode. 
This allows to have no other dependencies as well as enable (in the future) further processing 
directly on the in-memory directory structure. But in real life busy production clusters, where the first 
goal of an Hadoop SRE is to protect the [NameNode](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/NameNode), 
we'd be more comfortable to run a more decoupled version of HDFS-INotify.

So was born the project called Trumpet, in reference of the noise the elephant is producing when shouting.
